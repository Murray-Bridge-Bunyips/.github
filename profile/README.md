# Welcome to the Murray Bridge Bunyips!

*We are a South Australian FTC Team of >10 consistent members competing from the riverside region of Murray Bridge!*  

Our team includes members through grades 6–9, with hosted meetings twice a week. In addition, we often collaborate closely with other FTC teams, such as the RoboRoos and the Paladins of St. Paul's.  

This club was founded in 2018, and we continue to have new rookie members with all sorts of skill experience each year. As of today, we have hit a new record of members in the club at any given time throughout the years. Our iconic green theme represents the Bunyip in Murray Bridge, a staple to our hometown; we are enthusiastic as ever about our dignity and identity as a team.  

Keeping in mind, we also have a strong sense of imagination and creativity among our members, with the main focus on having fun and developing core and fundamental skills for all of our futures. As of 2022, the new season of FTC has allowed us to begin thinking more structurally with the help of our mentors and peers, bringing on new insights and outlooks for competitive play.  

As a club, we continue to thrive as an interconnected family, taking each step into new knowledge and a vast range of opportunities for our prosperous futures.  

***Gracious Professionalism!***  
— Lucas Bubner, Murray Bridge Bunyips Captain [2022-Current]
