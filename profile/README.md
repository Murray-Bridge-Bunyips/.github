## We are the Murray Bridge Bunyips!
*A rural South Australian FIRST Tech Challenge robotics club of >12 consistent members competing from the riverside region of Murray Bridge!*  

Our team includes members through grades 7–12, with weekly hosted meetings. In addition, we often collaborate closely with other FTC teams, such as the RoboRoos and the Popups, and with outreach communities beyond robotics.

Our club, hosted with venue via Murray Bridge High School, has given members ample opportunities to demonstrate not only their robot fabrication skills but also communication, entrepreneurship, and developing essential non-technical skills as part of an assessable extracurricular program. We're not just a robotics team but a network of future innovators of whom we are proud.

We were founded in 2018 and continue to have new rookie members with all sorts of skill experience each year. As of today, we have hit a new record of members in the club at any given time throughout the years. Our iconic overarching green theme represents the Bunyip in Murray Bridge, a staple to our hometown; we are as enthusiastic as ever about our dignity and identity as a team. In the 2022 and 2023 FTC seasons, we were fortunate to start two additional teams, the Murray Bridge Mulyawonks and the Murray Bridge Lizards!

Keeping in mind, we also have a strong sense of imagination and creativity among our members, focusing on having fun and developing core and fundamental skills for all our futures. As of 2024, the new INTO THE DEEP season of FTC has allowed us to hone our robust programming, building, and outreach skills with the help of our mentors and peers, bringing on new insights and outlooks for FIRST Robotics in rural Australia.

As a club, we continue to thrive as an interconnected family, taking each step into new knowledge and a vast range of opportunities for our prosperous futures.

***Gracious Professionalism!***
